## 1. Description
This is a very simple and low level breakout board for the INA2xx Current-Sense Amplifiers. Actually it's a breakout board for the 8-Pin and 10-Pin VSSOP footprint with only the footprint on it, nothing else.  The project was implemented with KiCAD, as single board or as a panel. It contains ready-to-use Gerber files for both, the single board and the panel.
